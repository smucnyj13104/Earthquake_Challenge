# Earthquake_Challenge
-The purpose of this challenge was to map earthquakes on a map while including boundaries of tectonic plates, modifying the color and size of the symbols representing where earthquakes are located according to their mangitudes, and having 3 different tile layers (views). A legend was included to explain the color/size of the symbols.
